	<h1>Albin Salazar, PhD Candidate</h1>
	<p>I am a Theoretical Computer Science PhD candidate in the <a href="https://team.inria.fr/antique/">Antique</a> team hosted at ENS-PSL and Inria-Paris and under the supervision of <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~feret/">Jérôme Feret</a>. My broad research interest is on leveraging static analysis techniques to develop faithful models in biology. I am interested on a diverse range of topics such as multi-scale systems representation, model reduction techniques, verification of machine learning methods to concentration- and time-scale separation in biology, cancer signalling networks, and personalised and precision medicine.</p>
	<p>Prior to my PhD, I obtained a masters in Quantitative Biology from <a href="https://master.cri-paris.org/en">CRI-Paris</a>, where I completed a variety of research experiences in experimental and theoretical biology. Additionally, I hold a bachelors degree in Chemistry from <a href="https://www.southernct.edu">Southern Connecticut State University</a> and where I contributed to research developing <i>ab initio</i> methods.</p>

	<h2>Learning by doing.</h2>
	<p>I am heavily committed to the practice of teaching, and believe that any person can contribute to (open) research. Consequently I co-founded <a href="https://home-education.fr">Home Association</a>, a non-profit orginization that seeks to implement project-based activities for University students such that the goal is to learn and develop skills. The theme of the projects encompasses the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and is context specific: I have taught in Ghana (2018), Rwanda (2019-present), and (soon) Costa Rica. My contribututions to teaching is programming, open hard-ware technology (e.g., arduino boards), and human-centered design.</p>
